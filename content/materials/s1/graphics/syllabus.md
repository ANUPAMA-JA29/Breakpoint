## Module 1

##### Introduction
- **Relevance of technical drawing in the engineering field**
- Types of lines
- Dimensioning
- BIS code of practice for technical drawing
*(No questions for the end semester examination)*

##### Projection of Points and Lines
- Projection of points in different quadrants
- Projection of straight lines:
  - Inclined to one plane
  - Inclined to both planes
- Trace of a line
- Inclination of lines with reference planes
- True length and true inclinations of lines inclined to both reference planes

## Module 3

##### Sections of Solids
- **Sections of solids:**
  - Prisms, Pyramids, Cone, and Cylinder (axis in vertical position)
