**COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO PROBLEM-SOLVING**

_(Introductory diagrammatic/algorithmic explanations only. Analysis not required)_

**Brute-force Approach**

* **Example:**
  * Padlock
  * Password guessing

**Divide-and-conquer Approach**

* **Example:**
  * The Merge Sort Algorithm
* Advantages of Divide-and-Conquer Approach
* Disadvantages of Divide-and-Conquer Approach

**Dynamic Programming Approach**

* **Example:**
  * Fibonacci series
* Recursion vs Dynamic Programming

**Greedy Algorithm Approach**

* **Example:**
  * Given an array of positive integers, each indicating the completion time for a task, find the maximum number of tasks that can be completed in the limited amount of time available.
* Motivations for the Greedy Approach
* Characteristics of the Greedy Algorithm
* Greedy Algorithms vs Dynamic Programming

**Randomized Approach**

* **Examples:**
  1. A company selling jeans gives a coupon for each pair of jeans. There are `n` different coupons. Collecting `n` different coupons would give you free jeans. How many jeans do you expect to buy before getting a free one?
  2. `n` people go to a party and drop off their hats to a hat-check person. When the party is over, a different hat-check person is on duty and returns the `n` hats randomly back to each person. What is the expected number of people who get back their hats?
* Motivations for the Randomized Approach
